 * @defgroup magma Magma: Hardware-accelerated 3D graphics API
 * @brief Interface for transforming and drawing 3D geometry with a focus on performance and customizability.
 * @ingroup display
 * 
 * Magma is a library that allows users to perform T&L (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform,_clipping,_and_lighting)
 * of 3D geometry in a highly customizable, hardware-accelerated fashion.
 * 
 * The key feature of magma that allows for most of its customizability is the support for vertex shaders, 
 * since they can be written to implement any arbitrary method of transformation and lighting (within the limits of the hardware of course).
 * Vertex shaders run on the RSP ("Reality Signal Processor") and can therefore make use of its special vector instructions
 * to speed up many of the necessary matrix and vector calculations.
 * 
 * The transformed and shaded triangles that result from the vertex shader are then directly sent to the RDP ("Reality Display Processor") 
 * for rasterization  without a roundtrip to the CPU. Other than that, magma does not communicate with the RDP. To configure things like 
 * render modes, textures, etc. the @ref rdpq library should be used.
 * 
 * Magma uses the rspq library (see @ref rspq.h) to interface with the RSP internally. In fact, many of magma's functions are just
 * wrappers around rspq commands and therefore support being recorded into rspq blocks (#rspq_block_t). These functions are marked as
 * such in their documentation with the sentence "Can be recorded into blocks".
 * 
 * ## Overview of magma's architecture
 * 
 * This is a list of frequently used terms and their definitions:
 * 
 * ### Vertex shader
 * This is a special type of ucode (#rsp_ucode_t) that implements the magma vertex shader interface. It contains some metadata to describe itself to magma,
 * and implements the vertex processing loop to perform the T&L. Magma comes with a builtin default shader that is fit for most purposes: @ref mgfx.h
 * 
 * ### Vertex input
 * Every vertex shader defines a set of vertex inputs. A vertex input is some value that a shader expects per vertex, for example its 
 * position, color, texture coordinates etc. Each vertex input is identified with an "input number", which is unique within the shader. 
 * The shader may define certain inputs to be optional.
 * 
 * ### Vertex layout
 * While the set of a shader's vertex inputs can be thought of as an interface, a vertex layout is like an implementation of that interface.
 * It is the physical memory layout of some vertex data that is passed to the vertex shader as input. Shaders may be configured to accept 
 * a range of different vertex layouts as their input, provided they are compatible. See #mg_vertex_layout_t for details.
 * 
 * ### Pipeline
 * A pipeline is an instance of a vertex shader that has been configured with a certain vertex layout. To actually draw any 3D geometry, 
 * a pipeline must first be created and then "bound". After a pipeline has been bound, all subsequent drawing commands will use its vertex shader.
 * A program can create as many pipelines as desired and switch between them at will by binding them. This is useful for both supporting
 * multiple vertex layouts and achieving different visual effects. See #mg_pipeline_t.
 * 
 * ### Uniform
 * Besides vertex inputs, a vertex shader also defines a set of uniforms. Uniforms are inputs to the shader that don't change per vertex.
 * Common examples are matrices and lights. Like vertex inputs, they have a unique identifier each, called the "binding number". 
 * Uniforms can be queried from a pipeline using the binding number. To make the uniform's values accessible to the vertex shader, 
 * they need to reside in the RSP's DMEM. That means to assign a value to a uniform, it must be loaded first. See #mg_uniform_t for details.
 * 
 * ### Vertex buffer
 * A vertex buffer is the source of vertex data that is to be transformed by a vertex shader. It is just a regular region of memory in RDRAM
 * and no special functions are required to create it. A vertex buffer must be "bound" to make its contents available to a vertex shader.
 * See #mg_bind_vertex_buffer for details.
 * 
 * ### Vertex cache
 * This is an internal memory buffer that the results of the vertex shader are stored into. Drawing geometry with magma actually happens in 
 * two distinct steps: First, vertices are "loaded" into the vertex cache, running them through the vertex shader in the process.
 * Triangles can then be drawn by referencing the tranformed vertices inside the cache. This way, vertices don't need to be transformed 
 * redundantly in case they are shared by multiple triangles. See #mg_load_vertices and #mg_draw_triangle for details.
 * 
 * ### Drawing command
 * These are functions that will actually draw geometry to the framebuffer. The most simple example is #mg_draw_triangle, which will draw
 * a single triangle. There are also more advanced drawing commands which can draw entire meshes at once: #mg_draw and #mg_draw_indexed.
 * Internally they will just call #mg_load_vertices and #mg_draw_triangle repeatedly until the entire mesh has been drawn.
 * Translating a list of indices to a sequence of vertex loads and triangle draws is expensive though, so it's best practice to record
 * them into rspq blocks (#rspq_block_t) if the indices don't change.
 * 
 * ### Fixed function states
 * There are some states that are built into magma. They can be set at any time to configure how geometry is being drawn.
 * Some of them are related to drawing triangles only, others are accessible to every vertex shader automatically. 
 * This is the list of functions that set these states. See their respective documentation for more information:
 *  * #mg_set_viewport
 *  * #mg_set_geometry_flags
 *  * #mg_set_culling
 *  * #mg_set_clip_factor
 * 
 * ## How to draw geometry: Quick guide
 * At initialization:
 *  1. Initialize magma using #mg_init.
 *  2. Create a pipeline from a vertex shader (for example mgfx) and a vertex layout that corresponds to your vertex data using #mg_pipeline_create.
 *  3. Query uniforms from the pipeline with #mg_pipeline_get_uniform.
 * 
 * During the rendering loop:
 *  1. Bind the pipeline using #mg_pipeline_bind.
 *  2. Load uniforms using e.g. #mg_uniform_load.
 *  3. Set fixed function states:
 *      a. The viewport, which is the area that geometry is drawn to (#mg_set_viewport).
 *      b. Geometry flags, which specify what type of triangles should be sent to the RDP (#mg_set_geometry_flags).
 *      c. The face culling mode (#mg_set_culling).
 *  4. Bind a pointer to your vertex data as the vertex buffer with #mg_bind_vertex_buffer.
 *  5. Draw the geometry by using one of the drawing commands, or by calling a rspq block with recorded drawing commands.
 * 
 * The order of steps in the rendering loop is not fixed, with some exceptions. Step 5 should obviously always happen last.
 * Step 2 should usually happen after step 1, though there are exceptions (see #mg_pipeline_bind).
 * 
 * The "mghello" example demonstrates the above steps in a minimal fashion. A more complicated example can be found in "mgdemo".

 * @brief Configuration of a pipeline's vertex layout.
 * 
 * This configuration specifies how the data from a vertex buffer should be fed into the vertex shader.
 * 
 * A vertex shader defines the set of vertex inputs it supports. A vertex input is defined by:
 *  * Its "input number", which is a unique identifier
 *  * An alignment requirement
 *  * Whether it is optional or not
 * 
 * The vertex layout of a pipeline is defined by its overall stride (the distance between consecutive vertices in the buffer),
 * and a collection of vertex attributes. Each attribute is defined by:
 *  * Its offset relative from the start of a vertex
 *  * An input number, which creates a mapping to some vertex input
 * 
 * To create a valid pipeline, its vertex layout must be compatible with the vertex inputs defined by the vertex shader.
 * A vertex layout is compatible with a shader if, and only if, all of the following requirements are met:
 *  * All of its vertex attributes have an input number that is present in the shader
 *  * There are no duplicate input numbers among the vertex attributes
 *  * For each non-optional vertex input in the shader, there is a vertex attribute with the respective input number.
 *  * All vertex attributes satisfy the alignment requirements of their respective vertex inputs. This is the case
 *    if, and only if, the vertex attribute's offset is a multiple of the required alignment.
 * 
 * The above implies that optional vertex inputs may be omitted from the vertex layout.
 * However, there is no further guarantee about the behavior of the shader in case of omitted inputs.
 * 
 * Also note that, besides alignment, there are no further requirements on the offsets of each vertex attribute.
 * This means they don't need to be packed tightly and may even overlap.
 * How many bytes are actually read per vertex input is defined by the vertex shader.

 * vertex shader can access during its runtime. The combined reserved memory for all uniforms in a pipeline is known as 
 * the pipeline's "uniform memory". The uniform memory can be thought of as some virtual address space which starts 
 * at 0 and goes up to however many bytes a pipeline's uniforms take up in total.
 * 
 * A uniform is defined by:
 *  * Its starting offset in uniform memory
 *  * Its size
 *  * An identifier which is called the binding number.
 * 
 * The binding number must only be unique for each uniform within a pipeline. Otherwise, binding numbers can take on arbitrary
 * values and must not even be consecutive or otherwise correlated with a uniform's location in uniform memory.
 * 
 * Uniforms are defined by the vertex shader that is referenced by a pipeline. All pipelines that reference the same
 * shader will contain equivalent sets of uniforms. Uniforms can be queried from a pipeline using #mg_pipeline_get_uniform.
 * 
 * To provide inputs to a vertex shader via uniforms, they must be loaded first using one of the uniform loading functions,
 * for example #mg_uniform_load or #mg_uniform_load_inline. Those functions will load the entirety of a uniform's memory at once.
