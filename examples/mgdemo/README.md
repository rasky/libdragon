# Magma Demo

This example is a showcase of libdragon's builtin high performance 3D graphics API, magma. 
It demonstrates how a relatively basic rendering engine could be built on top of magma's API using best practices to ensure reasonable performance.

This demo is quite complex and may not be the best introduction to magma's API. If you'd like to see a more simple example, check out the "mghello" example.
Also note that the specific approach shown in this example may not be suitable for every application or game. However, magma is a very flexible API and is meant to be suitable for practically any rendering scenario.
