# Magma Hello Triangle

This is a minimal example of how to get something on the screen using magma, libdragon's builtin high performance 3D graphics API. 
In typical "Hello Triangle" fashion, it simply renders a single static triangle with vertex colors.

Please note that this example only showcases a subset of magma's features due to its simplicity. 
It can be seen as an introduction to some of the API's basic concepts. 
If you'd like to see a more complete example of how to use magma for more realistic rendering tasks including best practices, check out the "mgdemo" example.
